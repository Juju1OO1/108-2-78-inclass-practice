## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oB-5hj1pO5g8FMpZbA7RgIG8NvCRx6WvLPwvleCEV4Q/edit#gid=987577191` <-  # 缺乏定義值
ss <- as_sheets_id(`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oB-5hj1pO5g8FMpZbA7RgIG8NvCRx6WvLPwvleCEV4Q/edit#gid=987577191`)
homework_sheet <- sheets_read(ss,sheet=1)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
